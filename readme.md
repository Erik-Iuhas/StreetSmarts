## StreetSmarts

This repository contains the code for the StreetSmarts project. Our objective is to provide padestrians with a navigational path displaying the precentage of sidewalks and obstructions along the way. By doing this we look to help those with disabilities and those who would like to travel along the sidewalk like parents and children. 

You can access our website at: https://www.streetsmarts.click/

On the website you can test our features, be warned that the sidewalk database is confined within the Stonecrest Park neighberhood and no sidewalk data currently exists outside of the location.
