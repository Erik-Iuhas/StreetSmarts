## StreetSmarts

This repository contains the code for the StreetSmarts project. Our objective is to provide pedestrians with a navigational path displaying the percentage of sidewalks and obstructions along the way. By doing this, we look to help those with disabilities and those who would like to travel along the sidewalk like parents and children. 

You can access our website at: https://www.streetsmarts.click/.

On the website, you can test our features. Be warned that the sidewalk database is confined within the Stonecrest Park neighbourhood, and no sidewalk data currently exist outside of the location.
